# Develative TypeScript Assessment

This guide assumes that you have installed `bun` in your machine.

If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running
`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.

## Development

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  bun install
  ```

  Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and supply the missing values (if any).

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  bun run dev
  ```
